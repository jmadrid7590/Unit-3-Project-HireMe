        <h1>Jasminda Madrid</h1>
        <p> I live in Long Island City, Queens. I attend Williamsburg Charter High School in Brooklyn, I am a Sophmore, and I currently have a <strong>100</strong> average. I chose Intro to Coding to be one of my electives in order to try something new! I am in Code Nation in order to open my horizon to future careers, and simply open doors for myself. I feel like this is a great opportunity for me to learn how the internet works, as it takes such a big role in our everyday lives. I think that it could be valuable to learn about it.</p>
        <p>My favorite colors are Red and Yellow. I feel like these are two very bright and appealing colors. I feel like yellow can be pretty soft depending on the shade that you use, and on the other hand red is very strong. I also love any pastel color.</p>

        <p>On the weekends and afterschool I love to hangout with my friends in the city. I am also apart of a college bound program called <a href="https://legaloutreach.org/" target="_blank"> Legal Outreach</a>. In this program I participate in
            <strong>Saturday Writing Class, Debate, Professional Exposure Events, Civic Engagement and Social Justice Comittee,</strong>
            and I am able to develop strong connections in the real world for when college comes around.
